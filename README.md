## Dope-Warz Game Disclaimer

**Dope-Warz** is a fictional, lighthearted game designed purely for entertainment and as a programming challenge. The concept involves a make-believe world where players buy and sell fictional substances in a competitive environment. **This game is in no way intended to promote or condone real-life drug use, sale, or illegal activities.**

The goal behind creating this game was to explore programming mechanics and build a fun, engaging experience. While the theme may be provocative, it was chosen to make the game more compelling than alternative themes like selling fruit or lemonade, which would not provide the same level of challenge or engagement. Please enjoy the game for what it isâ€”an exercise in game development and a fun diversion.


This is based off the classic game dope wars.  I wrote this in python just to see if i could do it.  I built this from memory so it's not exactly like the old game.  I
wrote this from scratch.  Enjoy! The world is yours!!
